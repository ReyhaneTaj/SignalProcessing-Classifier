# Signal Classification Using RML2016.10a Dataset

This repository explores signal classification using the **RML2016.10a** dataset through two approaches: direct classification with a 1D-CNN and feature-based methods.

## Approaches

1. **Raw Signal Classification (1D-CNN)**
   - Processed signals with Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 0.
   - Achieved test accuracy of ~75-77%.

2. **Feature-Based Classification**
   - Extracted 15+ features across time, frequency, and statistical domains.
   - Classified signals using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Dataset placeholder.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook implementation.
- `README.md`: Project overview.
